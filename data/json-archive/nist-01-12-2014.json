Users are encouraged to download interatomic potentials, and developers are welcome to contribute potentials for inclusion. The potentials provided have been submitted or vetted by their developers and appropriate references are provided. While many potentials are metallic and of the embedded-atom (EAM) form, other classes of potentials (e.g., MEAM, Reax, etc.) and materials are welcome. These could include semiconductors, polymers, and/or materials like carbides.  If you do not find the element or alloy potential you are seeking, send an email to Chandler.Becker@nist.gov, and we may be able to help. This site reflects what has been submitted, so it is not a complete survey of interatomic potentials for any or all systems. Here is a list of recent requests for potentials. http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/requests.html If you find this website useful, including using potentials you downloaded, please cite this project in addition to the proper interatomic potential reference: C.A. Becker,'Atomistic simulations for engineering: Potentials and challenges,' in Tools, Models, Databases and Simulation Tools Developed and Needed to Realize the Vision of ICME, ASM (2011). http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials Please note that, due to the wide range of interatomic potential functions and formats, It is the user's responsibility to check that the interatomic potentials produce expected results.",

        "description": "The NIST Chemical Kinetics Database includes essentially all reported kinetics results for thermal gas-phase chemical reactions. The database is designed to be searched for kinetics data based on the specific reactants involved, for reactions resulting in specified products, for all the reactions of a particular species, or for various combinations of these. In addition, the bibliography can be searched by author name or combination of names. The database contains in excess of 38,000 separate reaction records for over 11,700 distinct reactant pairs. These data have been abstracted from over 12,000 papers with literature coverage through early 2000. Rate constant records for a specified reaction are found by searching the Reaction Database. All rate constant records for that reaction are returned, with a link to 'Details' on that record. Each rate constant record contains the following information (as available): Reactants and, if defined, reaction products; Rate parameters: A, n, Ea/R, where k = A* (T/298)**n exp[-(Ea/R)/T], where T is the temperature in Kelvins; Uncertainty in A, n, and Ea/R, if reported; Temperature range of experiment or temperature range of validity of a review or theoretical paper; Pressure range and bulk gas of the experiment; Data type of the record (i.e., experimental, relative rate measurement, theoretical calculation, modeling result, etc.). If the result is a relative rate measurement, then the reaction to which the rate is relative is also given; Experimental procedure, including separate fields for the description of the apparatus, the time resolution of the experiment, and the excitation technique. A majority of contemporary chemical kinetics methods are represented. The Kinetics Database is being expanded to include other resources for the convenience of the users. Presently this includes direct links to the corresponding NIST WebBook page for all substances for which such a link is possible. This is indicated by underling and highlighting the species. The WebBook provides thermodynamic, spectral, and other data on the species. Note that the link to the WebBook is opened as a new frame in your browser.",
