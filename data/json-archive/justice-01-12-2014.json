In preparation for NLSY97 agencies outside the Labor Department were invited to submit questions for inclusion with the survey; the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) prepared a series of survey questions designed to assess problem behaviors among youth.\n\n","keyword":"employment schooling training fertility marital/relationship income assets","modified":"19-Jun-05","publisher":"DOJ/OJP/OJJDP","contactPoint":"Steve McClaskie","mbox":"mcclaskie@postoffice.chrr.ohio-state.edu","identifier":null,"accessLevel":"Public","accessLevelComment":"Public","bureauCode":null,"programCode":null,"accessURL":"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR03959","webService":null,"format":"SAS SPSS Stata ASCII Delimited PDF HTML","license":null,"spatial":null,"temporal":"\n1997-1997","accrualPeriodicity":null,"issued":null,"PrimaryITInvestmentUII":null,"landingPage":null},{"title":"The National Youth Risk Behavior Survey ","description":"The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) is an epidemiologic surveillance system established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor the prevalence of youth behaviors that most influence health. YRBSS consists of three components: 1) the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) a school-based survey nationally representative of students in grades 9-12 in public and private schools; 2) state/local YRBS similar school-based surveys in several states and cities; and 3) a variety of supplemental episodic surveys such as the 1998 National Alternative High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the 1995 National College Health Risk Behavior Survey. The national YRBS is the backbone of the YRBSS; it focuses on health-risk behaviors among youth that result in mortality morbidity disability and social problems during both youth and adulthood. The monitored behaviors include substance use behaviors that may result in violence and unintentional injuries sexual behaviors that may result in HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases unintended pregnancies unhealthy dietary behaviors and inadequate physical activity. The national school-based survey was administered first in 1990 then in 1991 and in every second year thereafter. The state and city school-based surveys are similar to the national survey but are not nationally representative.\n\n","keyword":"demographics weapons victimization sexual assault rape fights suicide; tobacco alcohol \nsexually transmitted diseases","modified":"3-Jul-05","publisher":"DOJ/OJP/OJJDP","contactPoint":"Dr. Jo Anne Grundbaum Ed.D","mbox":"jpg9@cdc.gov","identifier":null,"accessLevel":"Public","accessLevelComment":"Public","bureauCode":null,"programCode":null,"accessURL":"http://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/yrbs/data/index.htm","webService":null,"format":"HTML","license":null,"spatial":null,"temporal":"1995-2011","accrualPeriodicity":null,"issued":null,"PrimaryITInvestmentUII":null,"landingPage":null},{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey","description":"The Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) collects data on personal and household victimization by conducting an ongoing national survey of residential addresses.

That initial\n version of the questionnaire revealed that about 20 percent of the\n public had direct face-to-face contact with a police officer at least\n once during the year preceding the survey. At that time the principal\n investigator estimated that about 1 in 500 residents or about a half\n million people who had an encounter with a police officer also\n experienced either a threat of force or the actual use of force by the\n officer. The current survey an improved version of the 1996\n Police-Public Contact Survey was fielded as a supplement to the\n National Crime Victimization Survey (ICPSR 6406) during the last six\n months of 1999. A national sample nearly 15 times as large as the\n pretest sample in 1996 was used. The 1999 survey yielded nearly\n identical estimates of the prevalence and nature of contacts between\n the public and the police. This survey because of its much larger\n sample size permits more extensive analysis of demographic\n differences in police contacts than the 1996 pretest. In addition it\n added a new and more detailed set of questions about traffic stops by\n police the most frequent reason given for contact with police.\n Variables in the dataset cover type of contact with police including\n whether it was face-to-face initiated by the police or the citizen \n whether an injury to the officer or the citizen resulted from the\n contact crimes reported and police use of force.

The National\nCrime Victimization Survey (NCVS) previously called the\nNational Crime Surveys (NCS) has been collecting data on personal and\nhousehold victimization through an ongoing survey of a\nnationally-representative sample of residential addresses since\n1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to\ndevelop detailed information about the victims and consequences of\ncrime (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to\nthe police (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of\ncrimes and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of\nareas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\"\nPersonal crimes include rape and sexual attack robbery aggravated\nand simple assault and purse-snatching/pocket-picking while property\ncrimes include burglary theft motor vehicle theft and\nvandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions\ndesigned to determine whether she or he was victimized during the\nsix-month period preceding the first day of the month of the\ninterview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes\nagainst the household as a whole (e.g. burglary motor vehicle\ntheft). The data include type of crime month time and location of\nthe crime relationship between victim and offender characteristics\nof the offender self-protective actions taken by the victim during\nthe incident and results of those actions consequences of the\nvictimization type of property lost whether the crime was reported\nto police and reasons for reporting or not reporting and offender use\nof weapons drugs and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as\nage race gender and income is also collected to enable analysis of\ncrime by various subpopulations.","keyword":"assault \n\t\t   \t\tauto theft \n\t\t   \t\tburglary \n\t\t   \t\tcrime \n\t\t   \t\tcrime costs \n\t\t   \t\tcrime rates \n\t\t   \t\tcrime reporting \n\t\t   \t\tcrime statistics \n\t\t   \t\toffenders \n\t\t   \t\toffenses \n\t\t   \t\tproperty crimes \n\t\t   \t\trape \n\t\t   \t\treactions to crime \n\t\t   \t\trobbery \n\t\t   \t\tsexual offenses \n\t\t   \t\tvandalism \n\t\t   \t\tvictimization \n\t\t   \t\tvictims","modified":"56:19.0","publisher":"DOJ/OJP/BJS","contactPoint":"United States Department of Justice.

Beginning in 2005 the National Jail\n Census was broken out into two collections. The 2005 Census of Jail\n Inmates (CJI) collects data on the facilities' supervised populations \n inmate counts and movements and persons supervised in the community.\n The forthcoming 2006 Census of Jail Facilities collects information\n on staffing levels programming and facility policies. Previous\n censuses were conducted in 1970 1972 1978 1983 1988 1993 and\n 1999. The 2005 CJI enumerated 2 960 locally administered confinement\n facilities that held inmates beyond arraignment and were staffed by\n municipal or county employees. Among these were 42 privately-operated\n jails under contract to local governments and 65 regional jails that\n were operated for two or more jail authorities. In addition the\n census identified 12 facilities maintained by the Federal Bureau of\n Prisons that functioned as jails. These 12 facilities together with\n the 2 960 nonfederal facilities brought the number of jails in\n operation on June 30 2005 to a nationwide total of 2 972.

The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) funded the 1998 study as part of its DNA Laboratory Improvement Program. The BJS' National Study of DNA Laboratories was repeated in 2001. An expanded version of the data collection called the Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories was first conducted among all forensic crime laboratories in 2002. Data were collected from 2003 to 2004 on the organization functions budget staffing workload and performance expectations of the nation's forensic crime laboratories operating in 2002. A total of 306 of the 351 crime laboratories operating in 2002 responded to the census. The latest census obtained data from 351 of the 389 laboratories operating in 2005 including at least 1 laboratory from every state. The nation's publicly funded forensic crime laboratories performed a variety of forensic services in 2005 including DNA testing and controlled substance identification for federal state and local jurisdictions. The 2005 Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories obtained detailed information on the types of forensic requests received by these laboratories and the resources needed to complete them. The census also collected data on crime laboratory budgets personnel accreditations and backlogged cases.","keyword":"budgets \n\t\t   \t\tcrime laboratories \n\t\t   \t\tcriminal investigations \n\t\t   \t\tDNA fingerprinting \n\t\t   \t\texpenditures \n\t\t   \t\tforensic sciences \n\t\t   \t\tpersonnel \n\t\t   \t\tpolicies and procedures","modified":"33:38.0","publisher":"DOJ/OJP/BJS","contactPoint":"United States Department of Justice.

The data were constructed from the Administrative Office of the United States District Courts' (AOUSC) criminal file. Defendants in criminal cases may be either individuals or corporations. There is one record for each defendant in each case filed. Included in the records are data from court proceedings and offense codes for up to five offenses charged at the time the case was filed. (The most serious charge at termination may differ from the most serious charge at case filing due to plea bargaining or action of the judge or jury.) In a case with multiple charges against the defendant a \"most serious\" offense charge is determined by a hierarchy of offenses based on statutory maximum penalties associated with the charges.

The data are one of two supplementary files that should be used in conjunction with the primary analysis file which contains records for all defendants sentenced under the guidelines. These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of guideline computations which may or may not equal the total counts of conviction for that defendant dependent upon the grouping rules of the particular guideline in question (see Section 3D1.2 of the guidelines manual). As an example a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary. However if a defendant has five counts of bank robbery he or she will have five separate guideline computations because bank robbery is considered to be a nongroupable offense. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File.

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack robbery aggravated and simple assault and purse-snatching/pocket-picking while property crimes include burglary theft motor vehicle theft and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g. burglary motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime month time and location of the crime relationship between victim and offender characteristics of the offender self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions consequences of the victimization type of property lost whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting and offender use of weapons drugs and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age race gender and income is also collected to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.","keyword":"assault \n\t\t   \t\tauto theft \n\t\t   \t\tburglary \n\t\t   \t\tcrime \n\t\t   \t\tcrime costs \n\t\t   \t\tcrime rates \n\t\t   \t\tcrime reporting \n\t\t   \t\tcrime statistics \n\t\t   \t\toffenders \n\t\t   \t\toffenses \n\t\t   \t\tproperty crimes \n\t\t   \t\trape \n\t\t   \t\treactions to crime \n\t\t   \t\trobbery \n\t\t   \t\tsexual offenses \n\t\t   \t\tvandalism \n\t\t   \t\tvictimization \n\t\t   \t\tvictims","modified":"29:02.0","publisher":"DOJ/OJP/BJS","contactPoint":"United States Department of Justice.

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack robbery aggravated and simple assault and purse-snatching/pocket-picking while property crimes include burglary theft motor vehicle theft and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g. burglary motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime month time and location of the crime relationship between victim and offender characteristics of the offender self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions consequences of the victimization type of property lost whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting and offender use of weapons drugs and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age race gender and income is also collected to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS referred to as the collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.","keyword":"assault \n\t\t   \t\tauto theft \n\t\t   \t\tburglary \n\t\t   \t\tcrime \n\t\t   \t\tcrime costs \n\t\t   \t\tcrime rates \n\t\t   \t\tcrime reporting \n\t\t   \t\tcrime statistics \n\t\t   \t\toffenders \n\t\t   \t\toffenses \n\t\t   \t\tproperty crimes \n\t\t   \t\trape \n\t\t   \t\treactions to crime \n\t\t   \t\trobbery \n\t\t   \t\tsexual offenses \n\t\t   \t\tvandalism \n\t\t   \t\tvictimization \n\t\t   \t\tvictims","modified":"59:51.0","publisher":"DOJ/OJP/BJS","contactPoint":"United States Department of Justice.

An appeal can be filed by the government or the offender and the appellant can appeal the sentence the verdict or both sentence and verdict. Appeals may be terminated on the merits or on procedural grounds. Of those that are terminated on the merits the district court ruling may be affirmed reversed remanded to criminal court or dismissed. The data file contains variables from the original AOUSC files as well as additional analysis variables or \"SAF\" variables that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics Tables 6.1-6.5.

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack robbery aggravated and simple assault and purse-snatching/pocket-picking while property crimes include burglary theft motor vehicle theft and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g. burglary motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime month time and location of the crime relationship between victim and offender characteristics of the offender self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions consequences of the victimization type of property lost whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting and offender use of weapons drugs and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age race gender and income is also collected to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS referred to as the collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.","keyword":"assault \n\t\t   \t\tauto theft \n\t\t   \t\tburglary \n\t\t   \t\tcrime \n\t\t   \t\tcrime costs \n\t\t   \t\tcrime rates \n\t\t   \t\tcrime reporting \n\t\t   \t\tcrime statistics \n\t\t   \t\toffenders \n\t\t   \t\toffenses \n\t\t   \t\tproperty crimes \n\t\t   \t\trape \n\t\t   \t\treactions to crime \n\t\t   \t\trobbery \n\t\t   \t\tsexual offenses \n\t\t   \t\tvandalism \n\t\t   \t\tvictimization \n\t\t   \t\tvictims","modified":"23:50.0","publisher":"DOJ/OJP/BJS","contactPoint":"United States Department of Justice.

Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails.  In each of the years between the full censuses a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate\nbaseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails.  The 2010 Annual Survey of Jails is the 23rd such survey in a series begun in 1982.  The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases \ngrowth in the number of jail facilities changes in their rated capacities and level\nof occupancy growth in the population supervised in the community changes in methods\nof community supervision and crowding issues.  The ASJ\nalso provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population \nsupervision status of persons held and a count of non-citizens in custody.\nStarting in 2010 BJS enhanced the ASJ survey instruments to address topics on the number of convicted inmates that are unsentenced or sentenced and the number of unconvicted inmates awaiting trial/arraignment or transfers/holds for other authorities. In order to reduce respondent burden the ASJ no longer collects data on conviction status by sex.  Also new to 2010 data is collected on jails' operational capacity and design capacity.  Incorporating enhanced capacity measurements enables BJS to describe more accurately the variation and volatility of inmate bed space and crowding especially as they relate to safety and security in jails.\nTo address more directly issues related to overcrowding and safety and security in jails BJS started collecting data on staff and assaults against staff from the largest jails.  In the modifications to the ASJ starting in 2010 335 jail jurisdictions (370 respondents) included with certainty in the ASJ sample survey were asked to provide additional information (forms CJ-5D or CJ-5DA) on the flow of inmates going through jails and the distribution of time served staff characteristics and assaults on staff resulting in death and inmate misconduct.\nThe data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of\nJails 2010.  These data are used to track growth in the number of\njails and the capacities nationally changes in the demographics of the\njail population and supervision status of persons held the prevalence of\ncrowding issues and a count of non-United States citizens within the jail\npopulation.  The data are intended for a variety of users including\nfederal and state agencies local officials in conjunction with jail\nadministrators researchers planners and the public.

BJS and its subcontractor NORC at the University of Chicago led a national data collection effort focusing on prison sexual assault as reported by former state prisoners.\nThe focus of the National Former Prisoner Survey (NFPS) was sexual victimization among former state prisoners. The survey was divided into 6 sections. The first two sections were administered using a computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) method and focused on demographic and criminal history information. The remaining sections covering more sensitive information were administered using a touch-screen-audio-assisted-computer-self-interviewing (TACASI) method.\nSections A and B of the instrument collected demographic and criminal history information as well as information on placements during the last continuous incarceration. Sections C and D captured detailed inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization during the last continuous incarceration including the type of sexual activity identification of facilities at which such incidents occurred frequency of occurrences and other specifics regarding sexual victimization. Section E addressed staff-on-inmate sexual victimization and misconduct whether considered willing or unwilling and gathered specifics of activity indicated. The last section F focused on the impacts of sexual assault on victimized respondents as well as parole supervision characteristics for all respondents.\nThe National Former Prisoner Survey (NFPS) began in January 2008 and concluded in October 2008 and involved the random selection of approximately 250 parole offices across the country using probability proportional-to-size (PPS) sampling procedures.  Completed interviews were obtained for 17 738 respondents; supplemental data was collected on all former prisoners sampled in order to develop weights for national estimations.","keyword":"correctional facilities \n\t\t   \t\tcorrectional guards \n\t\t   \t\tcriminal histories \n\t\t   \t\tinmates \n\t\t   \t\tprison conditions \n\t\t   \t\tprison violence \n\t\t   \t\trape \n\t\t   \t\tsex offenders \n\t\t   \t\tsex offenses \n\t\t   \t\tsexual abuse \n\t\t   \t\tsexual assault \n\t\t   \t\tsexual behavior","modified":"33:15.0","publisher":"DOJ/OJP/BJS","contactPoint":"United States Department of Justice.

Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails.  In each of the years between the full censuses a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate\nbaseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails.  The 2011 Annual Survey of Jails is the 24th such survey in a series begun in 1982.  The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases \ngrowth in the number of jail facilities changes in their rated capacities and level\nof occupancy growth in the population supervised in the community changes in methods\nof community supervision and crowding issues.  The ASJ\nalso provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population \nsupervision status of persons held and a count of non-citizens in custody.\nStarting in 2010 BJS enhanced the ASJ survey instruments to address topics on the number of convicted inmates that are unsentenced or sentenced and the number of unconvicted inmates awaiting trial/arraignment or transfers/holds for other authorities. In order to reduce respondent burden the ASJ no longer collects data on conviction status by sex.  Also new to the survey data are collected on jails' operational capacity and design capacity.  Incorporating enhanced capacity measurements enables BJS to describe more accurately the variation and volatility of inmate bed space and crowding especially as they relate to safety and security in jails.\nTo address more directly issues related to overcrowding and safety and security in jails BJS started collecting data on staff and assaults against staff from the largest jails.  In the modifications to the ASJ starting in 2010 335 jail jurisdictions (370 respondents) included with certainty in the ASJ sample survey were asked to provide additional information (forms CJ-5D or CJ-5DA) on the flow of inmates going through jails and the distribution of time served staff characteristics and assaults on staff resulting in death and inmate misconduct.\nThe data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of\nJails 2011.

The Act requires a 10 percent sample of juvenile facilities to be listed by incidence of sexual assault. Data are collected directly from youth in a private setting using audio computer-assisted self interview (ACASI) technology with a touch-screen laptop and an audio feed to maximize inmate confidentiality and minimize literacy issues. The first year of collection includes nearly 200 juvenile facilities with an estimated 10 000 completed interviews with youth. \nThe NSYC utilized two questionnaires based on the age of the respondent.  The Older Youth questionnaire was administered to youths ages 15 and older and the Younger Youth questionnaire was administered to those 14 and younger.  The survey was divided into five sections.  Section A collected background information such as details of admission to facility and demographics including education height weight race ethnicity gender sexual orientation and history of any forced sexual contact.  Section B Facility Perceptions and Victimization included respondents' opinions of the facility and staff any incidence of gang activity and any injuries that had occurred.  Section C Sexual Activity Within Facility captured the types of sexual contact that occurred and the circumstances of sexual contact.  Section D Description of Events with Youth and Section E Description of Events with Staff Member focused on when and where the contact occurred the race and gender of the other youths or staff members if threats or coersion were involved and outcomes included whether or not the sexual contact was reported.\nOther variables include debriefing questions about respondents' experiences completing the survey interviewer observations created variables to summarize victimization reports (due to the complicated routing in Section C) weight and stratification data and administrative data about the facilities.","keyword":"correctional facilities (juveniles) \n\t\t   \t\tcorrectional guards \n\t\t   \t\tjuvenile detention \n\t\t   \t\tjuvenile inmates \n\t\t   \t\tjuvenile offenders \n\t\t   \t\tjuvenile victims \n\t\t   \t\tprison conditions \n\t\t   \t\tprison violence \n\t\t   \t\trape \n\t\t   \t\tsex offenders \n\t\t   \t\tsex offenses \n\t\t   \t\tsexual abuse \n\t\t   \t\tsexual assault \n\t\t   \t\tsexual behavior","modified":"55:15.0","publisher":"DOJ/OJP/BJS","contactPoint":"United States Department of Justice.

The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack robbery aggravated and simple assault and purse-snatching/pocket-picking while property crimes include burglary theft motor vehicle theft and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g. burglary motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime month time and location of the crime relationship between victim and offender characteristics of the offender self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions consequences of the victimization type of property lost whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting and offender use of weapons drugs and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age race gender and income is also collected to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.

The data were collected to examine change and stability in the operations of crime laboratories serving federal state and local jurisdictions. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) first surveyed forensic crime laboratories in 1998 focusing solely on agencies that performed DNA analysis. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) funded the 1998 study as part of its DNA Laboratory Improvement Program. The BJS' National Study of DNA Laboratories was repeated in 2001. An expanded version of the data collection called the Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories was first conducted among all forensic crime laboratories in 2002. For the 2009 study data were collected from 2010 to 2011 on the organization functions budget staffing workload and performance expectations of the nation's forensic crime laboratories operating in 2009. A total of 397 of the 411 eligible crime laboratories operating in 2009 responded to the census including at least 1 laboratory from every state. The nation's publicly funded forensic crime laboratories performed a variety of forensic services in 2009 including DNA testing and controlled substance identification for federal state and local jurisdictions. The 2009 Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories obtained detailed information on the types of forensic requests received by these laboratories and the resources needed to complete them. The census also collected data on crime laboratory budgets personnel accreditations and backlogged cases.","keyword":"budgets \n\t\t   \t\tcrime laboratories \n\t\t   \t\tcriminal investigations \n\t\t   \t\tDNA fingerprinting \n\t\t   \t\texpenditures \n\t\t   \t\tforensic sciences \n\t\t   \t\tpersonnel \n\t\t   \t\tpolicies and procedures","modified":"33:04.0","publisher":"DOJ/OJP/BJS","contactPoint":"United States Department of Justice.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has administered the NCRP since 1983. The United States Bureau of the Census served as data collection agent for BJS until October 2010 when Abt Associates assumed this position.\nFrom 2000 to 2009 NCRP data were archived each year in four year-specific files that corresponded to the four files that states were asked to submit to the Census Bureau.

For example the 2009 NCRP archive consists of prison admissions occurring in 2009 prison releases occurring in 2009 parole exits occurring in 2009 and prisoners in custody on December 31 2009.\nStarting in 2011 NCRP data will be archived in a single multi-year Term Record file. A Term Record represents a single period of incarceration for an individual offender. Each year the archived Term Record file will be replaced by a new Term Record file that incorporates new NCRP data collected and processed during the previous year as well as updates to previously collected data. The Term Records were created from the Prison Admissions (Part A) Prison Releases (Part B) and Prison Custody (Part D) records submitted by states since 2000.

The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack robbery aggravated and simple assault and purse-snatching/pocket-picking while property crimes include burglary theft motor vehicle theft and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g. burglary motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime month time and location of the crime relationship between victim and offender characteristics of the offender self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions consequences of the victimization type of property lost whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting and offender use of weapons drugs and alcohol.

Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails.  In each of the years between the full censuses a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate\nbaseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails.  The 2012 Annual Survey of Jails is the 25th such survey in a series begun in 1982.  The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases \ngrowth in the number of jail facilities changes in their rated capacities and level\nof occupancy growth in the population supervised in the community changes in methods\nof community supervision and crowding issues.  The ASJ\nalso provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population \nsupervision status of persons held and a count of non-citizens in custody.\nStarting in 2010 BJS enhanced the ASJ survey instruments to address topics on the number of convicted inmates that are unsentenced or sentenced and the number of unconvicted inmates awaiting trial/arraignment or transfers/holds for other authorities. In order to reduce respondent burden the ASJ no longer collects data on conviction status by sex.  Also new to the survey data are collected on jails' operational capacity and design capacity.  Incorporating enhanced capacity measurements enables BJS to describe more accurately the variation and volatility of inmate bed space and crowding especially as they relate to safety and security in jails.\nTo address more directly issues related to overcrowding and safety and security in jails BJS started collecting data on staff and assaults against staff from the largest jails.  In the modifications to the ASJ starting in 2010 335 jail jurisdictions (370 respondents) included with certainty in the ASJ sample survey were asked to provide additional information (forms CJ-5D or CJ-5DA) on the flow of inmates going through jails and the distribution of time served staff characteristics and assaults on staff resulting in death and inmate misconduct.\nThe data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of\nJails 2012.
